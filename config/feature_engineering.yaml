      operands: ["HourSpendOnApp", "OrderCount"]
      reason: "Efficiency metric - high value means browsing without buying (churn signal)"
      churn_hypothesis: "Customers who browse a lot but order little are likely window shopping competitors"
    
    - name: "orders_per_tenure_month"
      operation: "ratio"

      operation: "ratio"
      operands: ["HourSpendOnApp", "DaySinceLastOrder"]
      reason: "Recent engagement level - still browsing but not ordering?"
